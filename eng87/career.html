    <p>Whenever any building has some form of heating or cooling, a mechanical engineer was likely involved in the design. Almost every habitable structure employs some form of heating, cooling, or ventilation. As a result, the HVAC industry maintains a steady demand for skilled mechanical engineers.</p>

        Solar energy</a></p>
    <p>Mechanical engineering is crucial to the development of solar-powered
    infrastructure. Many solar arrays use moving parts that must be developed
    by mechanical engineers. In addition, the production of solar cells is
    automated. These autonomous systems must be designed and built by 
    mechanical engineers. The rapid rise of solar energy in recent years
    means that solar-based engineering jobs are in high demand.</p>
