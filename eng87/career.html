    <p>Whenever any building has some form of heating or cooling, a mechanical engineer was likely involved in the design. Almost every habitable structure employs some form of heating, cooling, or ventilation. As a result, the HVAC industry maintains a steady demand for skilled mechanical engineers.</p>
